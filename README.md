HomeAssistantFlows
==================

Flows for my home assistant environment

### About

I am in the process of moving from Smarthings over to Home Assistant, during the process I have decided to jump into Node-Red head first.   My intent to share my project with you is to maybe give someone starting out some insight and ideas.   

This is a good guide on how to import flows:  http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/copy-nodes-flows-node-red/

You should be able to import the RAW txt from flows.json into Node-Red and see the logic and the flows.     I will also try to keep some of the pictures of the flows up to date, but that will happen from time to time.

The first flow is designed around using the zwave scene from HA and exeucting a set of commands based on that value.

SceneManagement01.PNG is the main flow for this and it has links to the different lights involved in the scene:

SceneManagement02.PNG is where the links land to turn on or off different lights

Hope you find this usefull.
